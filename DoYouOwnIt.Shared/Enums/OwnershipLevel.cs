     * OwnershipLevel Enum:
     * -------
     * This enum represents the ownership level of a user regarding the format for a product.
     * Each value corresponds to a specific ownership status:
     * 0.) DontOwn - The user does not own the product, even when they have purchased it from the store.
     * 1.) Unknown - It is unclear if the user has any ownership over the format they are purchasing the product.
     * 2.) Licensed - The user kind of owns the product, but it is tied to a license that may be revoked at any time.
     * 3.) MissingFeatures - The user owns the product, but some features can be missing after a certain time due to online services being shut down.
     * 4.) NeedsMods - The user owns the product, but it requires additional modifications or patches to function correctly.
     * 5.) FullOwnership - The user fully owns the product, with no restrictions or missing features.
