# Do You Own It
Public repository for a web application where users can give information or reviews on a format for different products. Focus on if they own a specific product, the quality of a product based on a format, etc.

## Please Note
Currently I am having issues getting the project up and running as of right now due to costs. When I am able to get the project going I will be adding the link to the git repository. 
Additionally, the content of the public repository does not reflect the contents of the main private repo. This is because I am using different packages and services that utilize keys and hashes. In order to keep them private I have been editing the information for different keys and hashes private.

## Adding up the finishing touches before doing closed alpha testing
Will be doing closed alpha testing in the near future.

## Note
Much of the content has been altered to keep important information private, such as API keys, information regarding Hashing, etc.
